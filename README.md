# my space portfolio
hey yeah, this is my portfolio! It is a space design where you can view galaxies (pages) and planets for info or links. There is also the ability to create your own planets on the Public page.

## If you want to run it yourself:
- Create an ENV with
```
ADMIN_PASSWORD=Password
SECRET_KEY=SecretKey
```
- Make sure you have python installed.
- Make sure you have dotenv python installed and flask.
- Thats it, run the app using "py app.py" and it will run on port 8000
